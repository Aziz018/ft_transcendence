/**
 * Middleware that enforces authentication using a JWT stored in cookies.
 *
 * - Looks for the `access_token` cookie in the incoming request.
 * - If the token is missing, responds with `401 Unauthorized`.
 * - If present, verifies the token with `req.jwt.verify`.
 * - On success, attaches the decoded payload to `req.user`.
 *
 * @param {FastifyRequest} req - The Fastify request object.
 *                               Extended with:
 *                                  - `jwt` (from fastify-jwt)
 *                                  - `user` (decoded token payload).
 * @param {FastifyReply} rep - The Fastify reply object, used to send error responses.
 *
 * @returns {Promise<void>} Resolves when authentication is validated.
